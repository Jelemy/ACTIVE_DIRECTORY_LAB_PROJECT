# Kitauji High Concert Band Active Directory Lab Project

## Project Overview

This project is a hands-on lab designed to simulate the setup and management of a small organization's Active Directory environment. The goal is to practice core AD concepts such as organizational units, security groups, group policies, shared folders, and software deployment in a controlled virtual environment.

## Project Scenario

The Kitauji High Concert Band has recently decided to digitize their music workflow. Students need access to music composition software like MuseScore for sheet annotations and collaborative editing. They also require secure shared folders to distribute digital resources across different instrument sections. To manage this efficiently, the band hired an IT administrator to set up and maintain an Active Directory environment that handles user accounts, permissions, and group policies for the band members and leadership.
